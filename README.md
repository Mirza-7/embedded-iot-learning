# Embedded Systems & IoT – Learning Track by Mirza Asdaf

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Embedded Systems and IoT development. The goal is to build the technical foundation needed to contribute to real-world smart infrastructure solutions at [3AZ Digital Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/3az-digital-solutions), a startup focused on smart buildings and smart farming technologies.

---

## 🔧 Focus Areas

- Embedded Systems Fundamentals
- Microcontroller Programming (ESP32, Arduino)
- Sensor Integration (Temperature, Humidity, Motion, etc.)
- GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI Communication Protocols
- Real-time Data Collection & Processing
- IoT Dashboards and Digital Twin Concepts

---

## 🎯 Objective

To become proficient in embedded system development over the next few months by:
- Building and programming real hardware projects using ESP32
- Sending sensor data to cloud databases (e.g. Firebase)
- Creating basic dashboards that act as digital twins of physical systems
- Contributing to the development of smart infrastructure prototypes at 3AZ

---

## 🧪 Learning & Project Structure

This repo will evolve over time to include:
- ✅ Notes and resources from foundational study
- 💡 Mini-projects for core concepts (e.g. LED blinking, sensor reading)
- 🔌 Real hardware integrations (DHT11, motion sensors, relays, etc.)
- 🌐 Cloud data push and real-time monitoring
- 🧠 Final applied projects that reflect smart building or smart farm scenarios

## 📦 Project Modules (Coming Soon)

| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `01-blink-led` | First microcontroller project using GPIO | 🔜 Planned |
| `02-dht11-reader` | Reads temperature/humidity from sensor | 🔜 Planned |
| `03-esp32-firebase` | Send data to Firebase from ESP32 | 🔜 Planned |
| `04-smart-irrigation-prototype` | Water control using soil moisture & thresholds | 🔜 Planned |

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack

- **ESP32 Dev Board**
- **Arduino IDE / PlatformIO**
- **Firebase / ThingsBoard** (for cloud data)
- **C/C++ for embedded programming**
- **Optional**: Node-RED, MQTT, React (for dashboard)

## 📌 Why This Repo Exists

This repo serves two purposes:
1. **Personal Development** – to accelerate my technical growth in embedded systems.
2. **Portfolio** – to show initiative, self-learning, and applied IoT experience relevant to startups and embedded roles.
