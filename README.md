# Embedded Systems & IoT ‚Äì Learning Track by Mirza Asdaf

This repository documents my hands on learning journey in Embedded Systems and IoT development. The goal is to build the technical foundation needed to contribute to real-world smart infrastructure solutions at [3AZ Digital Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/3az-digital-solutions), a startup I'm working on that focuses on the digitalization of infrastructure through IoT and smart building technologies.

---

##  Focus Areas

- Embedded Systems Fundamentals
- Microcontroller Programming (ESP32, Arduino)
- Sensor Integration (Temperature, Humidity, Motion, etc.)
- GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI Communication Protocols
- Real-time Data Collection & Processing
- IoT Dashboards and Digital Twin Concepts

---

##  Objective

To become proficient in embedded system development over the next few months by:
- Building and programming real hardware projects using ESP32
- Sending sensor data to cloud databases (e.g. Firebase)
- Creating basic dashboards that act as digital twins of physical systems
- Contributing to the development of smart infrastructure prototypes at 3AZ

##  Learning & Project Structure

This repo will evolve over time to include:
-  Notes and resources from foundational study
-  Mini-projects for core concepts (e.g. LED blinking, sensor reading)
-  Real hardware integrations (DHT11, motion sensors, relays, etc.)
-  Cloud data push and real-time monitoring
-  Final applied projects that reflect smart building or smart farm scenarios

##  Project Modules (Coming Soon)

| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `01-blink-led` | First microcontroller project using GPIO |  Planned |
| `02-dht11-reader` | Reads temperature/humidity from sensor |  Planned |
| `03-esp32-firebase` | Send data to Firebase from ESP32 |  Planned |
| `04-smart-irrigation-prototype` | Water control using soil moisture & thresholds |  Planned |
